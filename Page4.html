<p>My motivation is rather simple, I want to expand my expertise and specialise in software development.<br>
I want more from IT than just the support roles i have experienced so far, and i lacked the qualifications to climb up <br>
So i am here to get those qualifications.</p>

<p>How do i stay motivated ? <br>
I have a goal, and i know how to reach this, and with every new skill and every development I see myself getting closer to my goal. <br>
This is what keeps my drive going</p>

<p>Besides the classes I also try to educate myself on programming in a multitude of programming languages, pure out of intrest really <br>
I watch a lot of videos on youtube and read articles about this too so I keep expanding my knowledge.<br>

There are always points i want to improve when it comes to myself, one of them being that i want to learn how to work in a way I dont cause stress for myself.<br>
I often start on things and eventually end up being overwhelmed simply because I take on more than I can chew. </p>
