<p>Im also active as a scouts leader in my weekends, I have a group of kids I guide they are aged between 15 and 18. <br>
We do all kinds of things, we are a waterscouting group but my own subgroup is predominantly land based. <br>
This means we do more landscout activities, like hiking,highroping and survivaling. <br>
We go on camps twice in a year, last year we went to luxembourgh for a week. </p>
