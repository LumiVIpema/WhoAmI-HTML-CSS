<P>I have worked in many fields, I also have been in de IT field for 5 years prior to starting this study, if it wasnt for Covid-19 I would probably not have made this choice because i did enjoy myself in the line of work I was in, but sadly when the virus struck I lost my position. <br>
But on a positive note it gave me the chance to invest in myself and follow a study I have desired to follow for quite a while.<br>
I am quite the jack of all traits, below i will list my precious work experience.
</P>
