<p>I consider all my former education as usefull, even thought they may not have much in common with each other <br>
I will always look for ways to use skills from past studies, it opens up doors and it makes mundane tasks more fun. <br>
I have studied the following studies and successfully finished them, i am currently studying for software developer.
